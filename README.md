# Overview
This web application allows users to select from four different disease prediction systems and get predictions based on the input features. Each prediction system was developed through extensive data analysis and model selection processes, ensuring high accuracy and reliability.

# Installation
To run this project locally, please follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install the required dependencies


# Usage
To start the Streamlit web app, run the following command in your terminal: streamlit run streamlit_app.py
This will launch the web app in your default web browser. You can then select the desired disease prediction system from the sidebar and input the required features to get a prediction.

# Dataset Description

# Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

Web Framework: Streamlit

Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn, XGBoost

Data Analysis and Visualization: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn


# Model Development Process
Each disease prediction system was developed through the following steps:

1. Importing the Dependencies

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

3. Data Preprocessing
   * Handling missing values
   * Handling outliers
   * Label encoding/One-hot encoding
   * Standardizing the data

4. Model Selection
   * Selected the most common 5 classification models
   * Trained each model and checked cross-validation scores
   * Chose the top 3 models based on cross-validation scores

5. Model Building and Evaluation
   * Selected best features using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
   * Performed hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search CV
   * Built the final model with the best hyperparameters and features
   * Evaluated the model using classification reports
